## It is upon us again
As usual, with little notice, Steam Next Fest is once again upon us. I had no plans for a Steam Next Fest this week; I'm off of work on vacation even though it's more of a staycation, but that limits the time I have to put into this.

Nevertheless, I have made some time for it and planned to use evenings to get through some games. I have only (compared to previous fests) downloaded 15 demos this time. I'll try to get through them and put the pages up for them in the Next Fest section.

## What about older Next Fest pages?
I will try to get to uploading older Next Fest and Completed pages before the end of the year. The backlog is ENORMOUS, but I really want to get everything posted and listed on here.

## The games
Here are the 15 demos I have downloaded with the links to their respective pages once up.

- Rift of the Necrodancer
- Windblown
- Wilmot Works It Out
- Divine Dynamo Flamefrit
- Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders
- AI Limit
- Blood for the Old Gods
- Card-en-Ciel
- Heroes of Hammerwatch II
- Mandragora
- Neverlooted Dungeon
- Slime Heroes
- Snow Bros. 2 Special
- V.A Proxy
- Warside
