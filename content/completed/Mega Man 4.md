Mega Man: The Sequel Wars is a homebrew Genesis/Mega Drive game in the vein of Mega Man: The Wily Wars, which was a remastered collection of Mega Man 1, 2 and 3. Sequel Wars aims to contain 4, 5 and 6 but currently is limited only to 4. It has a bunch of extra features like:
- Multiple playable characters (Mega Man, Proto Man, Roll)
- Various quality of life options
- Faster game speed
- Extra visual effects

It also benefits from a bit of modern game polish. A game that gives you modifiers to play with is always good in my book.

Apart from all this homebrew/remaster nonsense, it's Mega Man 4. The first of the classic Mega Man games to have the charge shot. I feel like in the past the charge shot in this game disappointed me but I feel like I have a newfound appreciation for it after playing this one. 

The levels were alright even though some of them were mostly mini-boss gauntlets rather than levels. A generally great time to go through, it does have one really annoying thing at the end that unfortunately returns in later titles: it features the worst Wily Capsule yet. It is a very annoying fight and it certainly isn't the last time Wily Capsule is a terrible final boss.
