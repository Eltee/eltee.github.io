Mega Man II, that is, Roman Numerals Two, or Rock Man World 2 in Japan, is the sequel to the no good Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge. In the same fashion as the NES games, the second one is a marked improvement on the first. It's still not incredible, mind you, but it gets more right than its predecessor did.

You have the slide now as well as access to Rush's abilities. The level design is still not great and cramped but nothing as terrible as the first game. The game still fakes you out with only four Robot Masters, followed by four more in the Teleporter Room, but this time these four extra Robot Masters also have their own stages.

These stages are, for some reason, much harder than the regular stages, but they're mostly manageable. The game again features a unique 9th Robot Master, and its weapon is needed for one of the Wily Machine forms. Or at the very least, one of its forms is weak to it.

It wasn't as terrible going through than the first Game Boy game, but it is still a lesser take on Mega Man compared to the NES originals. It feels like it is slowly getting somewhere but it is not quite there yet.

All in all, still not really a game I'd replay for actual fun, as it is still mostly rehashed Mega Man 2 and 3 content but in a lesser form factor, but it is much better than the first game for sure.
