description: "Chronological list of games I have completed, including blurbs, pictures and thoughts."

The games I complete were often listed on a different thread, each year, of my Twitter account. This allowed me to easily share them and also look them up at the end of each year. For reference,  [2024's list thread is found here.](https://twitter.com/Eltee78641/status/1622808691471958017)

I also used [rentry.co](https://rentry.co) Markdown pastebins to make half-assed articles about the yearly lists, but these will be supplanted by this blog, obviously.

Finally, [I also have a HowLongToBeat profile where I also catalogue the games I have beaten and give them vague times and scores.](https://howlongtobeat.com/user/Eltee78641)
