Phroag Detective is back with a second game mostly similar to the first one. There's a new case here, one about a town who had planned a parade for their new resident, only to find the parade venue got sacked the evening before the parade. They want to know who did it. Also, the new resident is an invisible wizard.

The game is largely identical to the first one in terms of what you can do, with some minor differences. There are a few characters more than the previous game, and they all have a lot more to say. They also all have a "quest" associated with them to solve, tracked in a new notebook interface introduced at the start of the game. It's more neatly structured than the first game, which is nice.

The various quests are fairly simple and are mostly solved in a cascading order; once you've talked to everyone you can solve one, which enables you to solve another, etc..

I feel mostly the same about this game as I did the first one, but I think I like it more because there simply was a bit more to it this time around. The tone and writing are still very much like the original, but that's not a bad thing.

There is a third and final game but I don't have it yet. I wonder if it has even more going for it.
