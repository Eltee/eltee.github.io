I remember first hearing about these Frog Detective games when the bundle with all three released everywhere. I had probably seen it on Switch and thought it looked cute. Which it is. But I remember hearing people speak about it positively, so at some point I started scooping them up on Steam.

The games are first person adventure titles where you're a frog solving some of the world's silliest crimes. You do so by walking around, grabbing items and talking to people. There literally is nothing more to it, and this game took about... 50 minutes overall. You get the idea, they're bite-sized adventure games.

The game is also silly enough that I could very easily see it be good for young kids; nothing awful happens in it and it is Funny but in the way a kid's movie is funny, if that makes sense.

This specific game was about a private island where ghost noises could be heard, and a team of ghost scientists hired to find out about the ghost noises who couldn't because they're all awful at their jobs.

In the end it's a small mid-evening romp, worth a chuckle or two, makes you feel good because it's cute and nice. I liked it but you know, it's like eating one cookie from the jar and moving on to something else, but in game form.
