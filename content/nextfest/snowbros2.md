Snow Bros is an old arcade game I don't know much about. From what I can gather, it's one of what I would call a "Bubble Bobble"-like; a level-based, one-screen game where you trap and punt enemies one way or another. In Bubble Bobble it's with bubbles, in Snow Bros it's snow. It's a fun gameplay loop, these Bobble-likes.

This game appears to be an improved remaster of Snow Bros 2 which came out for arcades in 1994. There seem to be a lot of unlockables here in the way of characters, all with redone portraits. I say redone, because this game lets you use the "original" portraits, which are uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

The remaster was sharp and the game seems fine, as I guess the original arcade game was. It's fun but it's "just" Snow Bros. At least from what the demo had to tell.
