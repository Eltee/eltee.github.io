# About
Hello, my name is Eltee, and I am a 30-something quebecois (french canadian) software engineer. I'm not interested in discussing software engineering however. At least not for now.

This website/blog is intended primarily for myself, to house posts relating to any of the following, which are often things I list/track elsewhere anyway:
- Games I have completed
- Steam Next Fest titles I have played
- VGM I'm thinking of
- Uploads to my YouTube channel
- Anything I want

It is still very much a work-in-progress. Different sections are available in the header or burger menu.

If anyone reading this has any suggestions (appearance, readablity), don't be afraid to share. I'm especially curious if it is easy and comfortable to read.
