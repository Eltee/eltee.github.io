# Eltee's online space
This website/blog is intended to house posts relating to any of the following:
- Games in general
- Games I have completed and I keep track of
- Steam Next Fest titles I have played
- Anything I want

It is still very much a work-in-progress and as such I'm not even entirely sure yet what I want to do with it. Posts of different types will be separated into sections available via links in the header.
