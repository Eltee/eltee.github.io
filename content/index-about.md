# About
This website/blog is intended primarily for myself, to house posts relating to any of the following, which are often things I list/track elsewhere anyway:
- Games I have completed
- Steam Next Fest titles I have played
- Games in general
- Anything I want

It is still very much a work-in-progress and as such I'm not even entirely sure yet what I want to do with it. Posts of different types will be separated into sections available via links in the header.

In the case of list categories, I will be back-posting articles with as accurate dates as possible (ex: game completed on a certain date)
